		<p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Computer Science in order to work in tech. During my summers at college, I had the opportunity to work with companies in various industries like media, automotive, and telecommunications. My career goal, regardless of the company, however, is to leverage data through analysis and visualizations.</p>

		<p>Let me know if you got cool data dumps to share!</p>

		<p>In my spare time, you can find me drawing in graphite or pastel, usually portraits, with a focus photographic realism. The attention to details required for these artwork satiate my need to be meticulous and precise. The photos that I am using as base are taken by myself with a Nikon D5100 and 35mm lense. I occasionally dabble in design and illustrations, improving ever so slowly. (I hope)</p>

		<p>On the off chance that I'm not weilding a pencil in hand, I'm usually engaged in video games of some kind. Lately, it has been League of Legends, Overwatch, and Divinity: Original Sin. All worth the time to check out if you haven't!</p>
