In the beginning of the week, classees were pretty straight forward. We went over python syntax and semantics. Structure of the class remained the same aside from the detour into a discussion of `Closures` in python.

The latter half of my week seemed like it lasted forever. I had one interviews with [Amazon][amazon] and another one with [FiveStars][five-stars]. They both went poorly from my perspective. For Amazon, the workplace simulation was fairly straight forward. It gauged problem assessment, long-term planning abilities, and various workplace etiquettes and resource engagement. After the simulation, three technical problems followed, which were of medium difficulty. However, I was not able to complete them due to my lapse of judgment of scheduling the FiveStars interview right after and estimating the Amazon interview would last a shorter period of time. So right after I went into the phone interview with FiveStars, very flustered I might add. The interviewer was really understanding and communicative, which helped me understand and solve the problem in the end. Though I felt like I took a little longer than I should have. Regardless, I tried my best and all I can do now is wait for replies.

To give my mind a break, I went to [TAMUhack][tamu-hack] to learn new technologies and make something not related to school. My friend, Thien, and I came up with the idea of reimagining how cosmetic businesses are managed. The industry is dominated by the Vietnamese population who tends to be old fashioned with their paper trails. Therefore, We designed a web interface that would assist an owner to manage the employee and provide metrics to determine profits and increase customer satisfaction through rewards and personalization. However, we did not go very far with the implementation due to the steep challenge of setting up Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Django web framework. After ingesting mountains of snacks and soda to keep us up, we both decided that we do not have enough time to finish the project for presentation at three o'clock in the morning. So with great sadness, we called for the termination of the project and spent the rest of the time playing around with chrome extensions.

After a jam-packed week, I'm ready for some quiet study time in preparation for the exam coming up on Thursday. Professor Fraij posted a list of relevant topics that will be covered on the test and approval for a sheet of paper containing course material. I will be sure to take advantage of that for maximum grades!

#### Tip of the Week
[Chrome extensions][chrome-extension] are pretty fun to write! Give it a go and see what task you can automate or simplfy.
