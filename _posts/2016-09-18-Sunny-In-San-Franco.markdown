Continuing last week's research of the Neflix Prize, I have a better understanding of the objective. Essentially we are predicting what a user would rate given the movie with the provided data. The data include ratings from other users and the actual ratings to help verify the estimate by using the Root Mean Square Error method ([RMSE][RMSE-link]). How we use the data is up to us. As a way to ease the process, students can voluntarily upload caches for other students. However, I have been busy for the latter half of the week, traveling in San Francisco. The experience was great to say the least.

I got to see various tech giants' headquarters and famous attractions like the Museum of Modern Arts and the Exploratorium. While on my trip, I also met Josh Ge, the creator of [Cogmind][cog-link], on the Bart train on accident. What are the chances! He was attending [Roguelike Celebration][rogue-link], a conference celebrating the rogue-like game genre. We chatted about his experiences working in the game industry as a sole developer of his game. Though the conversation is for another post, it was definitely enlightening and gave me a new perspective on the tech industry.

As for the day I was in class this week, Professor Fraij invited a guest speaker from Bloomberg. He talked about the company culture, benefits, and various responsibilities he has. I enjoyed the opportunity given to us and would certainly enjoy more of this talks in the future. Given that I am graduating soon, these interactions helps me network with potential employees, increasing my chances getting noticed! So, thank you very much Professor Fraij! 

I will be back in Austin on Monday and begin to work together with my partner on the project. We both have read up on the project and planned some pseudocode around last projects base implementation. As the week progresses, we will implement the functionalities and clear the issues as a team. We will also be executing the pair programming methodology to ensure quality, clean code.

#### Tip of the Week
Travel to the San Francico and tour the offices at least once in your life!
