Winding down from recruiting season, registration, and 50th-anniversary preparation, I am starting to readjust back into my regular schedule. However, it did mean little time was spent on the project this week but I am not that worried. During stage one, the page generation were already served dynamically with angular instead of simply rendering static HTML. The next step then became feeding angular with the correct JSON from our API, which involves filling out the database with data from the sources we scraped online. At the same time, pagination of the data can be implemented concurrently as that feature does not rely on the database. We can simply feed the controller tons of dummy data to simulate a subset of the entire database. 

Aside from the functionality of the website, the frontend also needs some touching up. Most importantly, the splash page deserved some improvements such as the addition of attention-grabbing elements ranging from short but impactful soundbites to moving images that convey the purpose of the database. Little CSS fixes are vital and critical to the presentation of the web application, meaning they will be corrected before the project is turned in.

As the due date closes in, we need to reach the last few milestone of our master plan! This of course depends on the availability of my team members. To not repeat the panic-inducing software development cycle, which was leaving everything last minute, I will take charge and make sure everything is going smoothly and no one is blocked by another person on the team. With high confidence and hope in team Spook, I can safely say we will get this done and done well.
