If you kept up with my blog, you would know that I had given the advice of starting projects early. Well, that went out of the window, into the road, and completely demolished by "fun" and "job hunting". As you probably guess what I am alluding to, Zach and I started really late in the project timeline of two weeks. We began on Wednesday, the day before the project was due. The funny thing is neither of us was panicking. Throughout the beginning of the week and the week prior while I was in San Francisco, we talked about our approach of constructing the heuristic that would predict the user's rating for a movie. It was only the codebase that we started to write late into allotted time. With determination and thorough inspection, Zach and I completed the project with time to spare. 

I do regret one thing, however. I did not contribute to the stash of caches and used Seth's and Jessica's caches. While it did save us tons of time and a bunch of, otherwise would be extraneous, work, I felt my pride extinguish a little. On the other hand, I have to give major props to Jessica and Seth for going the extra mile to make caches for fellow students. 

During the week, as well as completing the project, I emailed recruiters and engineers, set up interviews and went to interviews. It was a hectic week to say the least, though I am very happy with the results of my labour. Multiple companies in the Bay Area reached out to me or advanced me to the second round. It is another step towards my goal of living in the San Francisco area for a few years. Hopefully, offers will start rolling in as they make their decisions. I will keep applying in the mean time. All of this does mean I put off course work and focused on job hunting but I plan on catching up on the reading in the weekend. 

The next big obstacle, to my surprise, is not a project but a *test*. Not knowing what the format will be like, I can not start to prepare besides rereading the chapters and reviewing the quizzes. Perhaps professor Fraij will shed more light on the subject as next week approaches. 

#### Tip of the Week
Never hesitate to reach out to recruiters and engineers. Most of the time, they will appreciate your efforts and redirect you to the right person to get you in. Happy hunting and best of luck to you fellow students.
