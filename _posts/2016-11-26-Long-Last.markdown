Three months certainly flew by fast. I cannot believe I learned so much in such a short amount of time. The experience is comparable to having an internship where you build a web application with a team of four, each with their individual roles. Following a development process that you would at a real company, we succeeded in rolling out a working product into the world.

I would like to thank professor Fraij for being a great professor and making the efforts to help us learn well. My favourite part of the class besides the long term project would be the ones where he invited industry engineers to talk about their life and career. We really got a glimpse of what it would be like to work in the real world. I really appreciate the sincerity of these engineers and their kindness of providing life tips that you would only know if you lived through them. If you have read my previous post, you would know my feelings on the final project.

Though I did enjoy the class, there certainly are places where it can be improved. I wished professor Fraij talked more about the technology that was in the requirement, perhaps some demos to illustrate their basic usage. Like I mentioned before, I would have also liked if we followed the agile development process closer. We should have written user stories in the beginning and properly planned out our sprints and follow up with retrospectives. I'm sure with time and further refinement, the process will be smoother. Given that the process is improved, I would like to propose two big projects instead of two smaller ones and one big one. 

Ultimately, software engineering is one of the best and most useful classes I've taken at UT. The experiences I gained will carry on with me to my careers and personal development. I highly recommend this course to anyone who has a thirst of challenging themselves because this journey will definitely test their limits. You will make new friends and even strengthen your existing bonds. If you don't have the chance to take the course, I would encourage you to follow through the project stages anyway to show initiative and proactive personality.
