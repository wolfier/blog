Interviews and assessments dominated most of my time this week. Though I did set aside enough hours to study for the test and create my cheat sheet. Creating the cheat sheet took some energy but it was worth the effort in the end. The book reading section of the test was pretty straight forward given that you read the assigned chapters. With the page of notes, you really shouldn't be having any issues answering them. The coding portion of the exam wasn't particularly difficult either. It did require some careful inspection of what the requirements asked for. Now that I have taken one of Professor Fraij's test, I can better prepare for the final.

Aside from taking the test, I also took a glimpse at the next project, [IDB1][idb1]. There are a couple of technology listed that I have not used before with [Digital Ocean][digital-ocean] being one of them. However, there are more tools I am familiar with than the ones I am not, such as [Bootstrap][bootstrap] and [Flask][flask]. I am looking forward to starting the project and make a database similar to The Internet Movie Database, [IMDB][imdb].
There a couple of ideas I have: 

**Github Repositories** - Track progression of starred repositories.

**Company Listing** - Collect company information in the tech industry, including attributes like stock prices and careers opportunities. 

**Music Library** - List all songs by genre. 

Starting next week I will start looking into these tools that I am not familiar with and setup the environment for the IDB1 project. Given that I have already formed a group with Zach, Jessica, and Seth, I am very excited to begin making something I want to show to other people.

Also, I created a new tab in the nav bar of my blog titled [portals][portals]. That page contains other student blogs from both Professor Fraij's and Professor Downing's class. They are compiled in one location for your viewing pleasure! Currently it only has blogs of my friends, eventually I will add the rest of the blogs. 


#### Tip of the Week
Make sure to read the specification whenever there is one and read it at least twice. You would surprised the details you miss on the first pass.
